					As the University started its operations in June 1979, it had two Colleges
				of Agriculture located in Sta. Maria and San Carlos City; two Colleges of Arts and
				trade in Lingayen and Asingan; a College of Education in Bayambang; and a
				College of Fisheries in Binmaley.

				Bayambang to Lingayen. The College of Arts and Sciences was also formally
				created in Lingayen with the transfer of some courses from Bayambang Campus.
				The Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) Program was also offered for the first time to
